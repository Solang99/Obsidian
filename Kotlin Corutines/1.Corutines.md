- Corutine concepts
- Exception Handling

## What are corutines 
- Thread are very resource intensive, corutine otherwise are very light weigh cause they use [[Thread pool ]]. 
- They can be stop and be resumed at any time, they are not really bound to the thread.

### Basic concepts
- [[Scope]] : Is what create the corutine, it will provice lifecyle events.
- [[Context]]: The scope itself provide a context which rappresnt the state of  Corutine.
- ==Suspended funcition ===: Function that can be _"Suspended"_, so called inside a corutine.
- [[Job]]: Is a handle on a corutine, when create a corutine a job will be created and it can be used to stop a corutine.
- [[Deferred]]: A future result of a corutine, it' can be awaited.
- [[Dispatcher]] Assign a corutine to a therad.

### Exception handling
Exception behaviour will depend on corutine builder :
- Launch: 
	- Propagates through the parent-child hirachy
	- The exception will throw immediatly and job fail
	- Or can be captured in a try-catch block
- aync
	- Exception are deferred until the result is consumed
	- If the result is not consumed the exeception will never be thrown
	- Should use try-catch in the corutine or to wrap the await() call
