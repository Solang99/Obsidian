In computer programming], a **thread pool** is a software design pattern for achieving concurrency of execution in a computer program. Often also called a **replicated workers** or **worker-crew model**,a thread pool maintains multiple threads waiting for tasks "Task (computers)") to be allocated for concurrent execution by the supervising program. By maintaining a pool of threads, the model increases performance and avoids latency in execution due to frequent creation and destruction of threads for short-lived tasks
